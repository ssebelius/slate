# Introduction

Welcome to the Versus Developer API! The Versus API allows you to create tournaments for players to engage in competitive play for rewards and real money. 

Example calls and responses are displayed in the area to the right. JSON is shown by default. 

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate).

## Making Requests
```POST``` requests must have JSON encoded body and the ```Content-Type: application/json``` header.

```GET``` requests have the parameters provided in the query string.

## Errors
```
200 OK - Everything worked as expected.

400 Bad Request - Often missing a required parameter.

401 Unauthorized - Missing, Incorrect, or Invalid token.

404 Not Found - The requested item doesn't exist or does not match.

500, 502, 503, 504 Server errors - something went wrong.
```

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
